# Potato-Disease-Classification
**Project Title:** Potato Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

**Description:**
This repository contains a data science project for my academic course, where I built a machine-learning model to predict potato diseases using image analysis. The project is implemented in Django and Python, and it leverages deep learning techniques. It also includes a web interface for users to upload potato images and receive disease predictions.

**Features:**
- Image upload and prediction
- Machine learning model for potato disease classification
- Django web application

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Django
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-Learn
- HTML/CSS

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install project dependencies (requirements.txt).
3. Run the Django application.
4. Access the application in your web browser.

**Data Sources:**
The project uses a dataset of labeled potato disease images, which can be found at '/potato-diseases-classification-model/training/plantVillage'.

**Project Status:**
This is a completed project for my academic course.
